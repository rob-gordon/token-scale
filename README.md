# Token Scale

A simple library for storing design tokens with helpful reference features.

### To Do

- I want to reverse value() and get() functions in general... sigh
- Check if is a token chain is a string before trying to return a fluid representation, although it could be a color

#### Capping
- Token Scale should return something even if a size passed to get is out of range
- Token Scale should be allowed to set min/max on functional selectors as well
